# 📚 Data Science Learning Journey

A complete journey through **Python**, **Statistics**, and **Machine Learning** — includes daily assignments, hands-on projects, and structured learning resources from [**DSGuru**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dsguru/posts/).

This repository is my personal notebook, project hub, and portfolio as I explore and practice key concepts in Data Science.
